    "| **Category** | **Rule**  |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| 0. **PLAN BEFORE YOU CODE** | A. \"Pseudo code\" is writing out the broad steps in plain language. I often (almost always for complicated tasks) do this on paper, then translate it to code as an outline (in the code's comments). <br> <br> Maybe planning sounds boring and like a waste of time. I get it; I also want to [shoot first](https://youtu.be/la7uuFsCIrg?t=43) like [Han did...](https://youtu.be/93pXrmCdlI0?t=26)  but coders like Han often [end up looking like this guy](https://youtu.be/mLyOj_QD4a4?t=67)... |\n",
    "| | B. Break the problem into chunks/smaller <br>problems. This dovetails with rule 5.B below nicely. |\n",
    "| 1. Automation | A. Automate everything that can be automated, don't do point-and-click analysis! |\n",
    "| | B. Write a single script that executes all code from beginning to end |\n",
    "| 2. Version control | A. Store code and data under version control. Revisit the [GitHub workflow recipe](01_Motivation_and_Getting_Started.html#***-THE-WORKFLOW-RECIPE--***) as needed! |\n",
    "| | B. **Before checking the directory back in, clear all outputs and temp files and then run the whole directory!** (Check: Did it work right?) <br>  |\n",
    "| 3.  Directories | A. Separate directories by function |\n",
    "| | B. Separate files into inputs and outputs |\n",
    "| | C. Make directories portable |\n",
    "| 4. Keys / Units | A. Store cleaned data in tables with unique, non-missing \"keys\" |\n",
    "| | B. Keep data normalized as far into your code pipeline as you can |\n",
    "| 5. Abstraction - fncs/classes | A. Abstract to eliminate redundancy |\n",
    "| | B. Abstract to improve clarity |\n",
    "| | C. Otherwise, don't abstract |\n",
    "| | D. **Unit test your functions!** |\n",
    "| | E. Don't use magic numbers, define once as variables and refer as needed |\n",
    "| 6. Documentation | A. Is good... to a point |\n",
    "| | B. Don't write documentation you will not maintain |\n",
    "| | C. Code is better off when it is self-documenting |\n",

    "Let's apply those rules to our cursed analysis of character death in Game of Thrones and see if this makes the project easier to replicate (in terms of accuracy and time required).\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Note, there are other ways to efficiently divide up analysis than what I propose here that have merit! Do not take this **exact** scheme as \"gospel\".)_\n",
    "\n",
    "Iâ€™ve split the project into two sub-directories: \"build\" (whose function is to build the sample from the raw data inputs) and \"analysis\". These are two-sub tasks of any data project, and here, I've chosen to treat them as different functions and thus they get different folders (**Rule 3.A**).\n",

    "The build folder takes \"inputs\", which are processed by files inside \"code\", and places the analysis sample (now explicitly created!) in \"output\". Notice the inputs and outputs are clearly separated! (**Rule 3.B**) Temp files are created along the way, but are not \"output\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/dir-build.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Also, notice the new file `run_directory.py`.** It very quickly and plainly documents how to run the entire code in the \"build\" project (**Rule 1.B**), and makes it easy to do so every time (**Rule 2.B**) before you push it back to the master repo on GitHub (**Rule 2.A**). `run_directory.py` is so simple, it is self-documenting (**Rule 6.C**).\n",

But if our fearless TA tried to execute this file, it wouldn't work! (His Mac doesn't even have a `C` drive!) \n",
    "\n",
    "_Now_, `clean_data.py` loads `..\\input\\got1.txt`. The `..\\` tells it to look \"one level up\", then inside the input folder. _(Aside: You can go up two levels with `..\\..\\` and so on...)_"
